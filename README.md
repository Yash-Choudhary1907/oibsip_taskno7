Fraud detection in data analytics involves identifying and preventing fraudulent activities by analyzing data patterns and anomalies. 
It typically uses statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and historical data to spot unusual or suspicious behavior that may indicate fraud.
For example, in financial transactions, analytics can detect patterns that deviate from the norm, flagging potential fraudulent activities like credit card fraud or insider trading.
